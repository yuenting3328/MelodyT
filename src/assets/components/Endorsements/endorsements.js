    “I am writing in support of Ms. Tse Yuen-Ting, Melody, who was a student in the BA (Hons) in Visual Arts
    programme of the Academy of Visual Arts, HKBU from September 2017 to June 2019. During this time, Ms.
    Tse completed one studio course in Experience Design under my supervision as well as our Year 4 Research
    Practice course. As the Programme Director for the BA programme I had additional opportunities to
    monitor her progress across the years and therefore believe to know her well academically, creatively,
    and personally.”
