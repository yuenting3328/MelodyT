            Muji is a Japanese retailer which sells a wide variety of household and consumer goods. Muji's design philosophy is minimalist, and it places an emphasis on recycling, reducing production and packaging waste, and a no-logo or "no-brand" policy.

            I have studied Gmail's design and find their user icon to be quite impressive, as it offers quick access to several key actions, including changing, managing, and adding another account. Additionally, Gmail has incorporated intuitive micro-interactions that guide users through the product in an effortless and intuitive way, making for a more seamless user experience.

            <p className="mujiDescription" id="mujiideaDescription">
            Through the study of Muji's design and concept, it becomes evident that the brand not only advocates for simplicity and integration of design in daily life, but also remains grounded in its origins while looking towards the future. While Muji has successfully launched a wide array of daily use products, it has yet to break into the electronic product market. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            However, with the progress of technology and ever-evolving needs of modern society, electronic products have become an indispensable feature in daily life. Even for something as commonplace as water bottles, human requirements have evolved and are continuously being enhanced.
