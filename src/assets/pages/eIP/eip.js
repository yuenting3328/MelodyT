            Due to receiving positive feedback from clients of SFC, Automated Systems (HK) Limited has extended an invitation for me to join their team. The reason for this invitation is their recent acquisition of a new project from SFC, called e-Investment Products Project (e-IP Project). Their request is for me to lead the UX/UI Design aspect of this exciting new project.

            I collaborate closely with Business Analysts to understand and interpret user needs for our e-submission process. To achieve this, I engage in in-depth discussions with users in order to create detailed user journey that outline each step in the process. With this information in hand, I work with the Business Analysts to identify user requirements for transforming various applications into e-forms. Our aim is to create a seamless user experience that is as intuitive as it is efficient.

            Undertaking a project independently provided me with a valuable opportunity to navigate the entire design thinking process. Throughout the project, I honed my critical thinking skills and prioritized attention to detail, ensuring that all business objectives and user requirements were met in the development of e-IP service.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Collaboration with business analysts allowed me to gain a clear understanding of user needs through a logical approach to balancing design goals with project objectives. Meanwhile, my collaboration with development teams helped me to better understand edge cases and backend logic. As a result, I was able to build a component for the Design Library System, which streamlined the translation of design concepts into coding, making the project run smoothly and efficiently.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My approach involved a meticulous exploration of different design approaches. I engaged with internal and external users to conduct various experiments aimed at optimizing the user experience of the service. By involving stakeholders at every step of the process and continuously iterating, I was able to develop an intuitive and robust service that effectively meets all business objectives and user needs.
