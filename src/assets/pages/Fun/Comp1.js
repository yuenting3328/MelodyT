                    Introducing our friendly Canadian character! Meet our adorable beaver, proudly representing Canada and enhancing your website experience. Did you know that the beaver holds official status as a symbol of Canadian sovereignty? It received this recognition through the National Symbol of Canada Act, which was passed on March 24, 1975. However, the beaver has long been a cherished part of Canadian identity even before that.

                    The following video has been created as a means to showcase the staggering amount of wood waste that is discarded on a daily basis in Hong Kong. In order to address this issue, we have taken the initiative to collect nearly a ton of discarded wooden pallets and repurpose them into captivating artworks that serve as both a creative and illustrative representation of this problem. By ingeniously utilizing these reclaimed materials, we have successfully established an exhibition that not only redefines the concept of wood construction, but also serves as a visually striking and thought-provoking installation.
